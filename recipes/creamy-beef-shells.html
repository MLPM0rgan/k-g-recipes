        <p>
            It may not be fancy, but <em>man</em> will it hit the <strong>SPOT!</strong> This weeknight classic 
            gets a slightly spruced-up treatment that is sure to have the kids begging for seconds (and the wife
            too!)
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz medium pasta shells</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>0.5 medium sweet onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
            <li>“Several dashes” Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>0.75 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 
                to taste</li>
            <li>6 oz shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook 
                pasta according to package; drain.
            </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, 
                making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess 
                fat, set beef aside.
            </li>
            <li>Add onion to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until 
                translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in garlic and italian 
                seasoning until fragrant, about 1 minute
            </li>
            <li>Whisk in flour until light browned, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in beef stock and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil; 
                reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced and 
                slightly thickened, about 6-8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in pasta, beef, and heavy cream until heated through, about 1-2 
                minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in cheese until 
                melted, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
