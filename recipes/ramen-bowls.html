            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tbps unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp seasame oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>4 cups ckicken stock</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>0.5 cups scallions, sliced</li>
            <li>2 packs ramen noodles</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Farenheit</li>
            <li>Apply oil, salt, and pepper to chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Melt butter in oven-safe skillet on medium heat. Add chicken and cook until
                golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Flip, and cook for another 4-5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer skillet to oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until chicken is fully 
                cooked (internal temp of 165)
            </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, until shimmering. Add the garlic 
                and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and 
                mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.
            </li>
            <li>Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer 
                uncovered for 15 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.
            </li>
            <li>Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently 
                lower  the eggs (still cold from the drive) into the boiling water, and let 
                simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) to 8 minutes (for a soft, 
                set up yolk).
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer 
                the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, 
                or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice 
                in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.
            </li>
            <li>Chop the scallions and chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs 
                finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.
            </li>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. 
                Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with fresh scallions and the 
                soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.
            </li>
